Show informations about your posts shared on Facebook, with statistics and charts about the number of "like", comments and clicks received.

== Description ==

Show informations on your posts shared on **Facebook**, with statistics and charts about the number of "**like**", **comments** and **clicks** received.

For each post, are shown stats about share count, like count, comment count, total count and click count.
That are, respectively:

* The number of times users have shared a post on Facebook
* The number of times Facebook users have &quot;Liked&quot; the post
* The number of comments users have made on the shared story
* The total number of times the URL has been shared, liked, or commented on
* The number of times users have clicked back to the Share page from Facebook

The statistics of your posts are listed in a **table** with some **charts** and **filters**.

Comes with a primitive **localization** in all languages of WordPress.
